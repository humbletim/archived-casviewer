See the Firestorm build instruction text files plus the instructions at the following sites:

- http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Get_source_and_compile

You need to provision the Oculus Rift SDK yourself:
- Download SDK v0.2.4.b from https://developer.oculusvr.com.
- Copy the Include and Src folders, including subfolders, from OculusSDK\LibOVR into build-vc100\packages\include\LibOVR.
- If building Windows, copy libovr.lib from OculusSDK\LibOVR\Lib\Win32 into build-vc100\packages\lib\debug and \release.
- If building Max OSX or Linux, build the libovr binary per the instructions in the SDK's overview PDF and copy to the appropriate directories.

The Firestorm target names such as ReleaseFS_open are retained.

For example, to build your own private version without installer:
autobuild configure -c ReleaseFS_open -- -DPACKAGE:BOOL=FALSE
autobuild build -c ReleaseFS_open --no-configure

Building and running on Linux has not been fully updated. In particular, while much of the build scripts have been updated, certain Linux-specific files have not been renamed or updated, including:
- debian
- indra\linux_crash_logger
- indra\linux_updater
- indra\llwindow\ Linux specific versions of the llwindow*.h and .cpp files
- indra\newview\linux_tools
