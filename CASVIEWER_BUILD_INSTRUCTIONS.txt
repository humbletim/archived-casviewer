See the Firestorm build instruction text files plus the instructions at the following sites:
- http://wiki.phoenixviewer.com/fs_compiling_firestorm
- http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Get_source_and_compile

The Firestorm target names such as ReleaseFS_open are retained.

For example, to build your own private version without installer:
autobuild configure -c ReleaseFS_open -- -DPACKAGE:BOOL=FALSE
autobuild build -c ReleaseFS_open --no-configure

Building and running on Mac works. However, the following Mac-specific files have not been updated:
- indra\llcommon\llversionviewer.h.in
- indra\mac_crash_logger
- indra\mac_updater
- indra\newview\English.Lproj

Building and running on Linux has not been fully updated. In particular, while much of the build scripts have been updated, certain Linux-specific files have not been renamed or updated, including:
- debian
- indra\linux_crash_logger
- indra\linux_updater
- indra\llwindow\ Linux specific versions of the llwindow*.h and .cpp files
- indra\newview\linux_tools
