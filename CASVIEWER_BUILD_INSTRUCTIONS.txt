See the Firestorm build instruction text files plus the instructions at the following sites:
- http://wiki.phoenixviewer.com/fs_compiling_firestorm
- http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Get_source_and_compile

The Firestorm target names such as ReleaseFS_open are retained.

For example, to build your own private version without installer:
autobuild configure -c ReleaseFS_open -- -DPACKAGE:BOOL=FALSE
autobuild build -c ReleaseFS_open --no-configure

Building and running Mac and Linux targets has not been tested.
