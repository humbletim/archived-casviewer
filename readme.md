#### CtrlAltStudio Viewer Archaeological Dig Site 2022.02

Expedition notes:
- original CodePlex open source project recovered using the Way Back Machine [üèõ CodePlex ctrlaltstudioviewer snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://codeplexarchive.blob.core.windows.net/archive/projects/ctrlaltstudioviewer/*)
- mercurial (.hg) repo then ressurected as wayback => codeplex => ctrlaltstudioviewer.zip => sourceCode/
- corresponding .git version constructed using [frej/fast-export](https://github.com/frej/fast-export.git)
- the CAS code was originally forked from "Firestorm 4.4.0" branch (from the then-official Firestorm .hg repo)
  - but the Firestorm project has since migrated to .git
  - a common ancestry was partially synthesized by grafting CAS onto a "modern day" .git "Firestorm 4.4.0" base
- content captures from the archived CodePlex project page and documentation pages appear below for reference

>An Oculus Rift and Stereoscopic 3D Second Life / OpenSim Viewer
>===============================================================
>
>Features
>--------
>
>The CtrlAltStudio Viewer is based on the Firestorm Viewer and adds the following primary features:
>
>*   Oculus Rift support
>*   Stereoscopic 3D support
>*   Variable walk & fly speed
>*   Xbox Controller support
>*   Kinect for Windows support
>
>While the code the viewer is based on works on Windows, Mac, and Linux, the CtrlAltStudio Viewer code currently only runs on Windows.  
>
>Status
>------
>
>**This viewer is not being actively maintained.** The most recent Windows release is based on Firestorm 4.6.9 which was released in Dec 2014; there have been many improvements and bug fixes in Firestorm and other viewers since then that are not included in CtrlAltStudio Viewer. Unless you really need Oculus Rift or stereoscopic 3D support you should seriously consider using another viewer instead: either [üèõ Linden Lab‚Äôs viewer](https://web.archive.org/web/20160908183631/http://secondlife.com/support/downloads/) or one of the [üèõ other third party viewers](https://web.archive.org/web/20160908183631/http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Third_Party_Viewer_Directory) such as [üèõ Firestorm](https://web.archive.org/web/20160908183631/http://www.firestormviewer.org/).

>The CtlrAltStudio Viewer is licensed under LGPL. It is based on the [üèõ Firestorm viewer‚Äôs](https://web.archive.org/web/20160703193412/http://www.firestormviewer.org/) codebase under LGPL, which in turn is based on Linden Lab‚Äôs [üèõ Project Snowstorm](https://web.archive.org/web/20160703193412/http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Project_Snowstorm) codebase under LGPL. Many other viewers also provide their code under LGPL, thus promoting sharing of each other‚Äô work and meaning that code from them has also made its way into the Firestorm and Snowstorm code.
